Set up a dataset\n","2. Set up a model\n","3. Generate a `MaseGraph` from the model\n","4. Run Analysis and Transform passes on the `MaseGraph`\n","\n","Now consider the following problems:\n","\n","1. Explain the functionality of `report_graph_analysis_pass` and its printed jargons such as `placeholder`, `get_attr` ... You might find the doc of [torch.fx](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fx.html) useful.\n","\n","2. What are the functionalities of `profile_statistics_analysis_pass` and `report_node_meta_param_analysis_pass` respectively?\n","\n","## MASE OPs and MASE Types\n","\n","MASE is designed to be a very high-level intermediate representation (IR), this is very different from the classic [LLVM IR](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html) that you might be familiar with.\n","\n","The following MASE Types are available:\n","(Note from Aaron: do we have a page somewhere that have summarized this?)\n","\n","\n","## A deeper dive into the quantisation transform\n","\n","3. Explain why only 1 OP is changed after the `quantize_transform_pass` .\n","\n","4. Write some code to traverse both `mg` and `ori_mg`, check and comment on the nodes in these two graphs. You might find the source code for the implementation of `summarize_quantization_analysis_pass` useful.\n","\n","5. Perform the same quantisation flow to the bigger JSC network that you have trained in lab1.
